A. Cryptology and Cryptographic Communication

1. Why is plaintext vulnerable when sent over an insecure network?
Because plaintext cannot be sent over the internet
Because plaintext is always converted to ciphertext automatically
Because encryption makes communication slower
Because attackers can only modify encrypted messages, not plaintext
[x] Because attackers can read and steal the message without encryption
2. Which of the following is necessary for encryption to work?
A passive attacker like Eve
A secure internet connection
[x] An encryption algorithm and an encryption key
A backup copy of the plaintext
A third-party authentication server
3. To ensure the message is not readable to the attacker, the message has to undergo a/an ____ process. The resulting message will not be readable and is called ____
Decryption, plain text
Cipher text, encryption
Encryption, plain text
[x] Encryption, cipher text
Decryption, cipher text
4. What is the main difference between a passive attacker (Eve) and an active attacker (Mallory) according to CDDC Training materials?
Eve can decrypt messages, while Mallory cannot
Eve is a hacker, while Mallory is a security expert
Mallory always needs an encryption key, while Eve does not
A passive attacker always works offline, while an active attacker works online
[x] Mallory can alter or resend messages, while Eve can only observe communications

B. History of Cryptography

1. Why is post-quantum cryptography considered necessary in the future of cybersecurity?
[x] Because quantum computers can break current public-key encryption algorithms like RSA and ECC
Because quantum computers will make symmetric encryption obsolete
Because classical computers cannot decrypt messages encrypted with post-quantum algorithms
Because post-quantum cryptography eliminates the need for encryption keys
Because cryptographic security is only needed in government applications
2. What is the primary weakness of the Caesar cipher in modern cryptographic analysis?
It is resistant to brute-force attacks
It requires a computationally expensive decryption process
[x] It can be easily broken using frequency analysis due to its predictable shift pattern
It uses a key length that is too long for practical encryption
It was only designed to encrypt numerical values
3. Who introduced the concept of public key cryptography in 1976?
[x] Diffie & Hellman
Claude Shannon
Alan Turing
Blaise de Vigenere
Kerchoff
4. Why does a strong encryption algorithm require both confusion and diffusion?
[x] To obscure both the relationship between plaintext and ciphertext and the statistical structure of the plaintext
Because modern ciphers only use substitution (confusion) or permutation (diffusion), but not both
Because diffusion alone ensures ciphertext randomness, making confusion unnecessary
Because confusion and diffusion are only relevant for symmetric encryption algorithms
Because increasing the key length compensates for the lack of confusion or diffusion

C. Classification of Encryption Method
1. Bob receives a message from Alice that has been encrypted with Alice’s private key. Why is this message not confidential even though it is encrypted?
Because encryption only works when both sender and receiver share a key
Because asymmetric encryption does not support decryption
[x] Because anyone with Alice’s public key can decrypt it
Because encryption only works for data integrity, not confidentiality
Because Bob must use his private key to decrypt it
2. Why does a digital signature use a private key for signing instead of a public key?
Because using a public key would prevent verification
Because encryption and digital signatures must use different keys
Because a private key provides confidentiality for the message
Because private keys are stronger than public keys
[x] To ensure that only the legitimate signer could have produced the signature
3. What is the difference between public key cryptography and digital signature?
Digital signature requires plain text
[x] The difference lies in where to use the public and private keys
They do not have any differences
They have the same encryption method but different decryption methods
They have different encryption methods but the same decryption method
4. Which of the following is not an information security services that cryptography enables?
Authentication
Confidentiality
[x] Availability
Integrity
Non-repudiation
