Secrecy through RSA is an easy task.
Dex lets his public key be known so that other people like Star and BH-2000 can send messages to him.
However, he keeps his private key secret so that only he can read the messages. 

What about authentication?
Using RSA, how can people prove that the message is, undoubtedly, from Dex?
