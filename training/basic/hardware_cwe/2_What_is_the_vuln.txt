Challenge: what is the Vulnerability?
You are analyzing the JTAG protection mechanism in a SoC. Below is a snippet from a password checker based on HMAC-SHA256 authentication.

Can you spot the flaw that allows insecure access? what is the CWE for this Vulnerability


logic [31-1:0] data_d, data_q;
logic [512-1:0] pass_data;

Write: begin
  if (pass_mode) begin
    pass_data = { {60{8'h00}}, data_d}; // Suspicious: this is only 480 bits of zeros + 32 bits of data!
    state_d = PassChk;
    pass_mode = 1'b0;
  end
end


> Just try different possible answers (or do a google search). Answer is cwe-1191. (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1191.html)
```python
import requests

# The URL to submit the form to — replace with the actual URL where the HTML is hosted
url = 'http://52.76.13.43:8140'  # Change this to your real server endpoint

# List of possible CWE answers to test
cwe_list = [
    'cwe-1241',  # Predictable algorithm
    'cwe-1240',  # One-way hash w/o salt
    'cwe-1244',  # Improper access control for peripheral
    'cwe-1191',  # Debug access not properly restricted
    'cwe-1339',  # Insufficient entropy
    'cwe-327',   # Use of broken/risky crypto
    'cwe-326',   # Inadequate encryption strength
    'cwe-330'    # Use of insufficiently random values
]

for cwe in cwe_list:
    response = requests.post(url, data={'answer': cwe})
    if "Incorrect answer" not in response.text:
        print(f"✅ Likely correct CWE found: {cwe}")
        break
    else:
        print(f"❌ Tried {cwe} — Incorrect")
```
