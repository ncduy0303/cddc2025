A part of registry file has been converted to a text file.
I hear that a startup program is configured.
Do you mind looking for it?

Type the name of the file without the file extension.
e.g.) \\path\\path2\\Hello_World.exe â†’ CDDC2025{Hello_World}

> Look for [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]

Flag: CDDC2025{W3ll_d0n3_Y0u_F0un[)_17}
