1. What does the Windows Defender Firewall do?
Stores all user passwords securely
Manages Windows updates
[x] Controls ports that allow or block network traffic
Detects and removes malware automatically
Speeds up the computer’s performance
2. You are a cybersecurity researcher investigating a possible unauthorized change in a system’s hostname. Where can you quickly check this information?
Task Manager’s Performance tab

It automatically deletes hidden files every 24 hours
[x] It allows access to registry settings
It displays all system logs in real-time
4. A hacker has attempted to disguise a malicious application as a normal background service. You suspect it is running, but it doesn’t appear in Task Manager. What should you do?
Restart the system and hope the malicious application doesn’t reload
Disable all running background processes to see if the issue stops
Run a full disk defragmentation to remove the program
[x] Check the registry, services, and installed applications
Delete all unknown files in the Windows directory

B. Explanation of the Windows Prompt

1. What is the primary difference between a common user and an administrator in terms of system access?
Common users have full control of the computer, while administrators have restricted access.
Common users can access system files, while administrators cannot.
[x] Administrators can control all applications and system files, while common users have limited access.
Administrators are only allowed to run Microsoft Office applications, while common users can run any program.
Common users have higher privileges than administrators.
2. A hacker gains access to a general user account on a Windows system. What is the most effective way to limit their ability to cause damage?
Remove user accounts entirely so only the administrator can use the computer
Encourage users to run all programs with administrative privileges
Allow all users to have administrator rights to prevent permission issues
[x] Ensure that administrative actions require a password and are restricted to authorized users
Disable all passwords for easier access management
3. What is the primary purpose of authentication?
To grant full system access to all users
To encrypt user credentials for security
[x] To verify a user's identity
To track a user’s online activity
To determine what actions a user can perform
4. What happens if authentication is successful but authorization fails?
The user must re-enter their password multiple times
The system locks the user out permanently
[x] The user is identified but restricted from accessing certain resources
The system automatically grants administrator rights
The user gains full access to all resources
5. What is the significance of Windows OS being sensitive to user privileges?
It improves system performance.
It allows users to easily access all files on the computer.
It enables efficient management of system resources.
It enhances user experience.
[x] It prevents accidental damage to the system.
