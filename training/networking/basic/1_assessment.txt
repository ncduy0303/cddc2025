A. Basics of Networking

1. In the analogy of Alice sending a letter to Bob, what does Bobâ€™s address represent in a network?
A password
A delivery route
A network switch
A mailbox
[x] An IP address
2. What is the main purpose of an IP address in a network?
It stores user login credentials
[x] It identifies devices on the internet
It encrypts all data sent over the internet
It limits network access based on location
It increases internet speed
3. What is the valid range of values for each octet in an IPv4 address?
0 to 100
[x] 0 to 255
0 to 1024
1 to 500
256 to 1024
4. What is the primary difference between an IP address and a MAC address?
It encrypts communication between devices
Both are assigned dynamically by the network administrator
[x] An IP address is a logical address, while a MAC address is a physical address
A MAC address can be changed, but an IP address cannot
A MAC address is used only for internet communication
5. Which of the following is the correct order of the OSI Layer from the highest layer to the lowest layer?
Application Layer > Transport Layer > Datalink Layer > Presentation Layer > Session Layer > Network Layer > Physical Layer
[x] Application Layer > Presentation Layer > Session Layer > Transport Layer > Network Layer > Datalink Layer > Physical Layer
Application Layer > Session Layer > Presentation Layer > Transport Layer > Datalink Layer > Network Layer > Physical Layer
Application Layer > Presentation Layer > Transport Layer > Session Layer > Datalink Layer > Network Layer > Physical Layer
Application Layer > Transport Layer > Presentation Layer > Datalink Layer > Session Layer > Network Layer > Physical Layer

B. TCP/UDP Protocol
1. Why is UDP considered faster than TCP?
It uses a three-way handshake
It uses larger packet sizes
[x] It does not establish a connection before sending data
It encrypts data more efficiently
It sends multiple copies of the same packet
2. Which transport protocol is ideal for reliable file transfer?
HTTP
[x] TCP
FTP
UDP
HTTPS
3. What is the purpose of the 4-way handshake in TCP communication?
To speed up data transfer
[x] To properly terminate a TCP connection
To check for lost packets and retransmit them
To encrypt data before transmission
To establish a new TCP connection
4. Which transport protocol is ideal for video conferences (Zoom, Google Meet, etc)?
HTTPS
HTTP
TCP
FTP
[x] UDP

C. Well-known Network Services

1. What does ARP stand for?
[x] Address Resolution Protocol
Advanced Routing Protocol
Application Response Protocol
Automatic Resource Provisioning
Application Resolution Protocol
2. What is the primary purpose of the ARP protocol?
[x] To map an IP address to a MAC address
To route packets between different networks
To encrypt network communication
To assign IP addresses dynamically
To prevent unauthorized network access
3. What is the role of the DNS resolver in a DNS query?
[x] It recursively queries DNS servers to find the IP address of a domain
It assigns IP addresses to domain names
It stores all domain name records permanently
It is responsible for encrypting web traffic
It redirects web requests to different servers
4. Which security issue arises due to the lack of authentication in the ARP protocol
Directory Traversal
SQL injection attacks
Buffer overflow attacks
[x] Man-in-the-middle attacks
DNS Poisoning
