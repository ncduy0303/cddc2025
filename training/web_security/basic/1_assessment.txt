A. Web Service Fundamentals

1. What protocol does a web server use to provide services?
UDP
SMTP
TCP
FTP
[x] HTTP
2. In which scenario would an HTTP request NOT include a request body?
A DELETE request with authentication headers
A POST request submitting a form
[x] A GET request fetching a webpage
A PUT request updating a resource
A PATCH request modifying specific fields
3. A request was made to the web server. From the network tab of the inspect element, you can see a 301 status code, followed by a 500 status code. The web shows an 'Internal Server Error' message. What can be inferred from this?
The web has been deleted by the owner and doesn't exist anymore
The user's internet connection is unstable, leading to an interruption when loading the client resources and the subsequent 'Internal Server Error' message
[x] The web has been moved to another URL, after visiting the new URL the web server was unable to process the request. Hence returning the error 'Internal Server Error' message
The web page contains outdated or incompatible frontend scripts, triggering errors in the client-side execution and resulting in the 'Internal Server Error' message
The browser cache is causing conflicts with the server response, resulting in the error
4. Which of the following best describes the role of NGINX as a reverse proxy?
[x] It forwards client requests to a web server and relays responses back to the client
It is used exclusively for load balancing and does not proxy traffic
It encrypts all HTTP traffic automatically
It directly processes client requests without involving a web server
It only serves static files and does not handle dynamic content

B. Web Security Overview

1. What is the main purpose of the OWASP Top 10 project?
[x] It provides a list of the most critical web security vulnerabilities
It only applies to large enterprises
It is a set of security tools
It is a list of all known vulnerabilities
It replaces the need for security testing
2. Why should authentication never be processed on the client side?
It prevents brute-force attacks
It makes the application slower
It improves user experience by reducing login steps
[x] Client-side authentication can be easily manipulated and bypassed
It requires more server resources
3. What is the difference between Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Path Traversal?
LFI only affects Linux, while Path Traversal only affects Windows
Path Traversal is a client-side vulnerability
Path Traversal can only access files in the root directory
[x] LFI allows including files on the server, while Path Traversal allows accessing files outside the intended directory
LFI requires authentication, while Path Traversal does not
4. How can an attacker use a web shell after exploiting a File Upload vulnerability?
By bypassing the Content Security Policy (CSP)
By sending phishing emails from the server
[x] By executing OS commands on the server through the uploaded file
By injecting SQL commands into the database
By modifying the HTML structure of the website
5. What is the purpose of using the payload '..%2f' in path traverse bypass techniques?
Representing the parent directory
[x] Hexadecimal expression of ASCII code to represent forward slash
Payload for File Upload vulnerability
Method for encoding backslashes
Technique for encoding SQL injection
