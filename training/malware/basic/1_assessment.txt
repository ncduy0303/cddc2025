A. The Origin of Malicious Code

1. Bob was a software engineer who worked hard, but his boss treated him unfairly. After quitting, the company’s server and backups were wiped on Bob’s birthday. Investigators found Bob had planted code to delete everything on that specific day. He was later jailed.

What type of malware did he use?
Rootkit
Worm
Trojan
[x] Logic Bomb
Ransomware
2. How did hackers adapt to technological advancements in the late 1990s?
They created ransomware to attack industrial control systems
They stopped targeting web servers and focused only on local systems
They used botnets to mine cryptocurrency
[x] They discovered SQL injection to attack databases
They started using antivirus programs
3. What is the name of the malware with the characteristics below?

1. The initial outbreak happened in 2017
2. Utilize EternalBlue exploit
3. Targeting Windows OS
4. Works by encrypting the data and demanding payment
ILOVEYOU
[x] Wannacry
Zeus
Stuxnet
Cryptolocker
4. Why are rootkits difficult to detect and remove?
[x] They modify core system components and drivers
They spread only through email attachments
They only affect web browsers
They delete all files in the system
They rely on social engineering instead of technical methods

B. The definitions of Malwares

1. How can hackers use macros to deliver malware?
By exploiting vulnerabilities in network hardware
By creating new user accounts on the victim’s system
By disabling all security features in the operating system
[x] By embedding malicious commands in Office documents
By directly modifying the computer’s firmware
2. What is the main function of a macro in computer programs?
Automated data retrieval
Enhancing MS Office security
None of the given options
[x] Automating tasks with a series of commands
Grouping source code in C
3. How do attackers make phishing emails more convincing?
By encrypting the recipient’s files before sending the email
By infecting the recipient’s computer with a virus before sending the email
By modifying the recipient’s email settings
By gaining full control over the recipient’s operating system
[x] By using personal information to craft a believable message
4. Why is ransomware that uses asymmetric encryption harder to recover from than symmetric encryption?
Because asymmetric encryption requires an internet connection to function
Because symmetric encryption requires more computational resources to decrypt
[x] Because asymmetric encryption uses two separate keys, making decryption impossible without the private key
Because symmetric encryption is weaker and can be easily broken
Because asymmetric encryption can only be used on large files

C. Categorised Malicious Code Behaviour

1. Jake installs a free video editing software he found on an unknown website. After installation, his antivirus stops working, and his system settings start changing without his permission. Even after scanning with multiple security tools, he can't detect any malware. What type of malware is most likely responsible?
[x] Rootkit
Adware
Ransomware
Trojan horse
Macro-based malware
2. Sarah receives an email from her company’s HR department with an attached Excel file named "Salary_Adjustments_2025.xlsm". When she opens it, a security warning appears asking her to "Enable Macros." Shortly after enabling it, her computer starts acting strangely, and sensitive company data is transmitted to an unknown server. What type of malware is likely responsible?
Adware
Trojan horse
[x] Macro-based malware
Ransomware
Rootkit
3. You recently downloaded a seemingly legitimate application on your smartphone from an unofficial app store. The app promised enhanced customization options for your device. However, you've noticed some unusual behavior lately. Your phone's battery drains quickly, and there are occasional lags in performance. Additionally, you've been receiving strange pop-up ads even when the suspicious app is not open. What type of malware is most likely responsible?
Worm
Rootkit
[x] Adware
Spyware
Trojan horse
4. What is the significance of understanding the concept of "malware family," and what is the benefits for security researchers?
It allows researchers to focus on one type of malware for targeted defenses
It helps predict new malware variants by understanding their evolution
It helps create tools that make malware more effective
It simplifies reverse-engineering malware without advanced tools
[x] It helps identify shared traits among variants, improving detection and mitigation
