B. Definition of Cyber Forensic

1. "The collection of volatile evidence is determined by prompt action, so the whole process must proceed without delay" is emphasized by which principle of digital forensics?
[x] Promptitude
Procedural continuity
Integrity
Righteousness
Reappearance
2. "Data abstraction and categorization" is done during which phase of the digital forensics process?
Acquire the Evidence
Report/Testimony
Delivery/Confirm
[x] Research/Analysis
Investigation Preparation
3. Why is it essential to perform analysis on a copy of a hard disk instead of the original hard disk?
To reduce storage space usage
To allow multiple analysts to work on the same evidence at once
[x] To prevent corrupting the data on the original hard disk
To make modifications easier during the investigation
To increase the speed of analysis
4. Upon arriving at the scene, the criminal's PC is still turned on. Why might unplugging the power cord be preferable to shutting it down to preserve its data?
Unplugging prevents the hard drive from encrypting itself
Shutting down can cause hardware failure
[x] Shutting down the PC will remove volatile data in the memory
Shutting down will make deleted files unrecoverable
Unplugging ensures the system remains in a usable state
5. Which one of these commands will get you the BIOS time in Linux?
sudo systemsetup -gettime
[x] timedatectl status
systeminfo | find /i "BIOS"
wmic path Win32_UTCTime get *
wmic bios get smbiosbiosversion, releasedate

3. How does NTFS differ from FAT?
FAT is designed for high-security environments, while NTFS is not
NTFS is only compatible with older operating systems, while FAT is for modern systems
[x] NTFS supports file permissions and security, while FAT does not
FAT supports file compression, while NTFS does not
NTFS uses a simpler structure, while FAT is more complex

BMP supports transparent backgrounds, while JPG and PNG do not
BMP uses advanced lossless compression, unlike JPG and PNG
BMP is a vector-based format, while JPG and PNG are raster-based
2. What is steganography?
[x] The practice of concealing information within other non-secret data
A cryptographic hashing function used for data integrity
A method of compressing files to reduce their size
The process of encrypting messages using public and private keys
A technique for detecting unauthorized access to a system
