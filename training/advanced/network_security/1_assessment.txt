B. Port Scan

1. Which network layer does a SYN flood attack target?

65636
65536
65435
65635
4. Which tool is widely used for port scanning?
[x] Nmap

C. Sniffing

1. What mode must a network interface be in to capture all packets, including those not addressed to it?
Broadcast mode
Secure mode
Normal mode
[x] Promiscuous mode
Encrypted mode
2. Why is sniffing in a hub environment considered a passive attack?
Because it disrupts network traffic
Because it only works with encrypted traffic
[x] Because all packets are already broadcast to every device
Because it actively manipulates packet data
Because it requires exploiting a security vulnerability
3. How do attackers sniff packets in a switched network environment?
By enabling Wi-Fi scanning mode
[x] By attacking the ARP protocol
By modifying firewall settings
By using the ifconfig command
By using DNS poisoning
4. A security analyst is monitoring network traffic using Wireshark. They need to find all packets exchanged between a specific client and server. Which Wireshark feature should they use?
MAC filtering
Export objects
[x] Follow stream
Protocol hierarchy
Traffic shaping
5. A forensic investigator is analyzing a network breach and suspects sensitive files were transferred. What Wireshark feature can help them retrieve these files?
Packet injection
Follow stream
Promiscuous mode
[x] Export objects
IP filtering

D. Spoofing

1. What is the primary characteristic of a spoofing attack?
Encrypting files for ransom
[x] Gaining trust through impersonation
Using brute-force techniques
Sending legitimate emails to users
Exploiting software vulnerabilities
2. In an ARP spoofing attack, what role does the attacker's machine typically play?
Establishes an encrypted tunnel for secure interception
Modifies DNS records to redirect victims to phishing sites
Acts as a DHCP server to assign malicious IP addresses
[x] Impersonates the legitimate gateway to intercept traffic
Exploits SQL vulnerabilities to gain network access
3. What is the primary objective of a DNS spoofing attack?
To block a user's internet access
To replace MAC addresses in an ARP table
To manipulate routing tables in a network
[x] To redirect users to malicious websites
To disrupt DNS servers through DDoS attacks
4. What must an attacker do first to launch a DNS spoofing attack?
Overload the DNS server with fake requests
Obtain administrator access to the victim’s system
[x] Gain a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) position
Modify the victim’s ARP table manually
Infect the DNS server with malware
5. Bob is using his laptop on a company network when he suddenly notices that his internet connection is slow. Meanwhile, an attacker has launched an ARP spoofing attack. Shortly after, Bob logs into his company’s internal system.

What can the attacker do in this case?
[x] Intercept and read Bob’s login credentials
Modify Bob’s ARP table to prevent him from accessing the internet
Encrypt Bob’s traffic to protect it from external threats
Use SQL injection to gain access to the company's database
Shutdown Bob's laptop

E. Denial of Service

1. Which of the following is a key difference between DoS and DDoS attacks?
DoS attacks target multiple victims, while DDoS attacks focus on one victim
[x] DoS attacks come from a single system, while DDoS attacks come from multiple systems
DoS attacks are easier to mitigate than DDoS attacks
DoS attacks use multiple systems, while DDoS attacks originate from a single source
DoS attacks are more powerful than DDoS attacks
2. Which of the following techniques is commonly used in Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks?
[x] Exploiting open resolvers to amplify attack traffic
Sending fake authentication requests to trick users into revealing credentials
Using a computer to send a massive number of requests to the target
Injecting malicious SQL queries into a database
Utilizing infected computers to send packets
3. An attacker floods a target server with a large number of TCP SYN packets but never completes the three-way handshake. As a result, the server keeps resources allocated for half-open connections, eventually becoming unresponsive.

Which type of attack is the attacker using?
[x] SYN flood attack
ICMP flood attack
UDP flood attack
HTTP flood attack
DNS amplification attack
4. A financial institution notices a sudden spike in traffic to its online banking system, causing severe slowdowns for legitimate users. Security logs indicate that multiple servers worldwide are sending a large volume of UDP packets to their system. The IT team also discovers that many of these requests originate from public DNS resolvers.

What type of attack is most likely happening?
brute force attack
[x] DNS amplification attack
SQL injection attack
ransomware attack
Phishing attack
5. A small e-commerce website experiences sudden downtime. The administrator checks the logs and finds that a large number of HTTP requests are coming from different IP addresses, all requesting product pages repeatedly. The server’s resources are exhausted, causing it to crash. The administrator suspects an attack that mimics normal user behavior but at a massive scale.

Which type of attack is most likely occurring?
Man-in-the-Middle attack
ARP Spoofing
[x] HTTP Flood attack
Zero-day exploit
SQL Injection
