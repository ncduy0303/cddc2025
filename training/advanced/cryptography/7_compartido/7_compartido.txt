We need to intercept Cypher's communication to be able to infiltrate into his data facility.
Here, I have prepared you a scenario for you to learn.

Alice and Bob are exchanging a secret key using the Diffie-Hellman protocol.
The secret key they shared will then be used by Alice as the AES key to encrypt the flag.

You are able to intercept and modify the messages they send to each other.
How can you get the flag?
