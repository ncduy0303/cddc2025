Hashing is a method that takes data and returns a fixed-sized string.
Hashing algorithms are one-way functions; meaning that once data is hashed, it is extremely difficult to retrieve the original input.
This is why passwords are stored in databases as hash format.

However, some hash values can be "reversed" using certain tools.
For this challenge, crack the following MD5 hash and wrap the answer in the flag format "CDDC2025{   }".

Hash: daeccf0ad3c1fc8c8015205c332f5b42

> Use online md5 decoder tool such as https://10015.io/tools/md5-encrypt-decrypt

Flag: CDDC2025{apples}
