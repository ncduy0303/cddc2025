Substitution and Transposition
Encryption and Decryption
Key Expansion and Permutation
[x] Confusion and Diffusion
Hashing and Salting
2. Using a symmetric key algorithm, two people need one shared key to communicate, and three people need three keys. How many keys will four people need?
4
20
[x] 6
16
9
3. What does CBC stand for in cipher mode of operation?
Cipher Bit Code
[x] Cipher Block Chaining

5. If you encrypt an image with ECB mode, the image would still be slightly visible. Why is that?
In ECB, data is compressed before encryption
In ECB, random padding is added to every block
In ECB, each pixel is encrypted separately with a unique key
[x] In ECB, the same input is encrypted into the same output
In ECB, the entire image is scrambled uniformly
