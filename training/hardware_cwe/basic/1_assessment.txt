A. Overview

1. What does CWE stand for?
Confidential Weakness Engagement
Central Weakness Enumeration
Continental Wrestling Entertainment
[x] Common Weakness Enumeration
Canadian Wrestling Elite
2. Which statement about hardware vulnerabilities is MOST accurate?
[x] They can arise from design flaws, manufacturing defects, or insecure configurations
They can be prevented by installing a firewall
They are only a concern for enterprise environments
They only apply to proprietary hardware, not open-source designs
They are always fixed through software updates
3. Why are hardware vulnerabilities particularly concerning in critical infrastructure?
Because software patches are always ineffective in mitigating hardware security issues
Because attackers cannot exploit software vulnerabilities if hardware is secure
Because hardware vulnerabilities only affect legacy systems and not modern devices
[x] Because they can be difficult to patch and may have severe real-world consequences
Because physical access is always required to exploit hardware vulnerabilities

B. Protecting the Hardware

1. Which of the following is an example of a firmware-related security risk?
Attackers planting malicious software on preinstalled applications
[x] Unauthorized modifications to firmware that introduce security flaws
Firewalls failing to block unauthorized firmware updates
Running outdated antivirus software
Employees using weak passwords for system login
2. What is a key security concern related to attacker-controlled operating systems?
[x] They allow attackers to bypass security controls and access protected data
They prevent unauthorized users from booting the system
They require specialized hardware to be exploited
They make software patches more effective
They only affect legacy systems, not modern ones
3. Which of the following is the definition of Improper Access Control?
Involves vulnerabilities introduced by physical access to hardware components, such as bypassing physical security measures or modifying hardware circuits
Occurs when a hardware device is shipped with default settings or configurations that are insecure and easily exploitable
Program or system which tries to store more data in a buffer, which leads to memory corruption
Exploitation of information leaked through physical characteristics such as power consumption, timing, or electromagnetic emissions
[x] Insufficient restrictions on who can access or modify resources, leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation
